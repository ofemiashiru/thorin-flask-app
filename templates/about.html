    The formation of the group grew out of a meeting Gandalf had with Thorin in Bree which kindled Thorin's interest in
    recapturing his long lost family inheritance. (Thorin's grandfather had been the King under the Mountain when Smaug
    came
    and took it.) Remembering that he had once known an adventurous Hobbit on his travels in the Shire, Gandalf decided
    to
    add Bilbo to their company because he knew that stealth and cunning were preferable to force. Gandalf also believed
    that
    someone like Bilbo could keep the sometimes prideful and stubborn Dwarves from rash action. The superstitious
    Dwarves
    also considered thirteen to be an unlucky number, and as Gandalf had planned to leave on other business, welcomed a
    fourteenth to fill into their party.
