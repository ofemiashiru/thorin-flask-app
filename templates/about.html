    The formation of the group grew out of a meeting Gandalf had with Thorin in Bree which kindled Thorin's interest in
    recapturing his long lost family inheritance. (Thorin's grandfather had been the King under the Mountain when Smaug
    came
    and took it.) Remembering that he had once known an adventurous Hobbit on his travels in the Shire, Gandalf decided
    to
    add Bilbo to their company because he knew that stealth and cunning were preferable to force. Gandalf also believed
    that
    someone like Bilbo could keep the sometimes prideful and stubborn Dwarves from rash action. The superstitious
    Dwarves
    also considered thirteen to be an unlucky number, and as Gandalf had planned to leave on other business, welcomed a
    fourteenth to fill into their party.

        <h3>Thorin Oakenshield</h3>
        <p>
            Thorin II was born in TA 2746 to Dwarf prince Thráin II in the city of the Lonely Mountain. Early in his
            youth, he and
            the other Dwarves of the Lonely Mountain were forced to flee by the dragon Smaug in TA 2770. While in exile,
            he quickly
            grew to become a capable warrior. This was demonstrated when he participated in the Battle of Azanulbizar in
            TA 2799. He
            fought with one of the Dwarven armies beneath the East-gate of Moria. At some point in the fighting, his
            shield broke,
            and using an oaken tree branch found on the ground as a shield, he gained the epithet "Oakenshield," which
            would remain
            with him even in death.

        <h3>Fili and Kili</h3>
        <p>
            Fíli and Kíli were brothers, the youngest of the thirteen Dwarves who set out with Thorin Oakenshield's
            company, along
            with Gandalf and Bilbo Baggins, to reclaim the Lonely Mountain from the dragon Smaug.

            Fíli and Kíli were the two most active Dwarves of Thorin's company, and, apart from Balin and possibly
            Bombur, they
            appear more frequently as "individual" characters in J.R.R. Tolkien's The Hobbit than the rest of
            Thorin's companions,
            who are most often named only in group-reference.

        <h3>Bifur</h3>
        <p>
            Whilst he was a descendant of the Dwarves of Khazad-dûm, Bifur was not related to the royal House of Durin.
            Most of his
            familial relations are unclear, and what is known of his parentage is very little. He and his family were
            driven out of
            their home in the Lonely Mountain by the dragon Smaug, and were forced to live in exile, where the Dwarf
            warrior worked
            as a toy maker. Following Thorin II Oakenshield to a new life at his halls in the Blue Mountains, he
            continued his life
            as a toy maker.
